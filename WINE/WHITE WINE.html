    <td><h1><u>SEMILLON</u></h1> 
    <p>Semillon is a golden-skinned grape used to make dry and sweet white wines, most notably in France and Australia. In France, the SÃ©millon grape is grown mostly in Bordeaux. There, it is blended with Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle. When dry, it is referred to as Bordeaux blanc and is permitted to be made in the appellations of Pessac-Lacognan, Entre-deux-mers and other less renown regions. In this form, Semillon is generally a minor constituent in the blend. 
When used to make sweet white wines of Bordeaux, such as the wine of Sauternes and Barsac, it is often the dominant variety. In such wines, the Semillon is attacked by the "noble rot" of Botrytis cinerea which consumes the water and thus concentrates the sugar present in the grape pulp. </p>
